## Getting Started
### ⚠ RETCON IS UNFINISHED AND DOESN'T HAVE ANY RELEASE BUILDS ⚠ <br>
### Release Build 
The recommended way to get started with RETCON is by downloading the lastest [release build](https://github.com/Opabina/RETCON/releases)

### Compiling yourself
In order to compile RETCON by yourself you'll need [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/3.1)<br>
Start by cloning the git repository using either ``https://github.com/Opabina/RETCON.git`` or ``git@github.com:Opabina/RETCON.git``<br><br>

Afterwards open ``RETCON-Engine.sln`` with Visual Studio. From there right-click on ``RETCON-Engine`` in the Solution Explorer and press ``Build Solution``<br>
Otherwise you can also press ``CTRL+Shift+B`` on your keyboard to build the solution.<br><br>

If everything works, you'll see ``========== Build: 2 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========`` inside Visual Studio's Output Console<br>
If anything fails, please [create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) or ask for help on the [official discord server](https://discord.gg/NwBhYhtgjZ)!
